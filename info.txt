Spanish is a language spoken throughout the world, 
and despite this, many are unaware of it's 
rich history. Spanish originates from the Iberian
Peninsila (present day Spain and Portugal) 
and is a descendent of the formal Latin of the 
roman empire. The Spanish spoken today derives 
from the Castilian Spanish that emerged during 
the Reconquista in the 13th century. This means
that the Spanish spoken today is over 700 years 
old. The reason that Spanish speaking countries
can be found in multiple contenents is because 
of the Spanish and their desire to spread 
their language across the world. This conquest 
was started in 1491 when Colombus reached the 
Americas and began what was known as the 
Conquista. This effectively brought the Spanish 
to the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and Asia.
